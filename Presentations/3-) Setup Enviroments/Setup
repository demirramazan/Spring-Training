-> JDK must be installed

How to Download and Add Spring Jar Files

Spring repo Link --> repo.spring.io/release/org/springframework/spring/
Choose the latest release and download the zip file on the top. xxxxx-dist.zip
Extract the zip and go to lib folder.
Copy all the jar files there.
Go to your project and create lib folder under your project.
Paste the jar files inside of this folder.
Spring also depends on Apache Commons Logging. So we need to download it also. --> commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/
Click on Download and find "commons-logging-xxx-bin.zip" file
And copy paste it under the lib folder as well.
As last steps --> Right click on the project and go to properties.
		--> Java Build Path --> Libraries --> Add Jars --> go to lib folder and add all the jar files.
